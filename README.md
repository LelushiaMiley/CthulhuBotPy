# CthulhuBotPy
A recreation of Discord's client but for bots. Also has special features built in, such as image manipulation and GIF creation.

# Plans Going Forward:

- Create an app, as close to Discord's client as possible, that loads, asks for login details (bot's token+name), authenticates them, saves them (if requested), and loads the main GUI.
